## Introduction

Make sure all participants have a Github account (and remember their passwords!). If they don't, they should be creating one during intro and during the stash section.

Lots of quirks and details to git, even for regular users. For example, only recently did I understand the [difference between an unstaged and untracked file](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-an-unstaged-and-an-untracked-file-in-Git).

## Review of Basic Git Commands
Commands to review: `git init`, `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git log`, `git remote`, `git fetch`, `git pull`, `git push`, `.gitignore`

## Stashing

`git stash` puts away any uncommitted changes (either staged or unstaged). For those familiar with CS data structures, it is a stack -- last in, first out using `git stash` and `git stash pop`. 

#### Demo/Exercise: Start a code change, stash for more pressing feature, then pop/apply the stash with original.

* Initialize a repo.
* Start editing a file called code.py.
*

## Branches

#### Exercise: Create and edit a local branch, then merge with master (fast-forward).

* Initialize a repo.
* Commit a file called `file.txt` with text `Parent commit` on the first line.
* Create a branch **my_experiment**.
* Switch to it.
* Add a line to `file.txt` with text `Feature commit 1` and commit the changes.
* Merge the branch with **master** (remember: you need to be on **master** to do that).
* Delete the branch.


#### Exercise: Create another local branch, but cause a merge conflict.

* Create a branch **another_experiment**.
* Add a line with text `Feature commit 2` and commit the changes.
* Switch to **master**, and add a line `Improvement of master`, and commit the changes.
* Now try to merge the **another_experiment** branch with master.

***You stumble into a merge conflict!***

----
## Merge Conflicts

#### Exercise: Go through steps to resolve the conflict.

Possible Scenarios:
* two people add material at different places of the file
* two people change the same line in a document
* person A adds a line, person B deletes a different line

## Collaboration Workflows

Two different permissions strategies, with a few different feature workflows.

### Permissions strategies: Centralized and Forking Workflows

The **Centralized Workflow** is simple. There is a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project. All users to whom you'd like to give *pull*, *push*, or *admin* permissions can be added as collaborators to the repository.

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow

#### Demo: Show how to add users as a collaborator to a repository.

The **Forking Workflow** is a bit more complicated, but often used for open source projects. It allows for an individual or team to moderate the code being added to the central repository. Additionally, it enables anyone to submit code for inclusion -- not just those who were given permissions ahead of time.

To contribute, a user will fork the central repository, which creates a remote repository under my own Github account. For example, I may fork this upstream repository (**uwescience/git-intermediate**) to my personal Github account (**bernease/git-intermediate**). When I've completed changes on my fork, I can submit a pull request which will get reviewed, screened, and hopefully merged in by the maintainer.

### Development strategies: Simple, Feature Branching, and Gitflow Workflows

The **Simple Workflow**, as defined by Bernease, is how we all started out. Have a single branch, the **master** branch where all new features and code changes are committed. Collaborating on a single branch will often necessitate rebasing or remembering to pull from the remote before any commits.

Any sizable features are created in new branches when following the **Feature Branching Workflow**. After the author is satisfied, they will merge their feature branch into **master**.

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

Lastly, the **Gitflow Workflow** is a structured workflow that's commonly used in large collaborations and open source projects. There are many branches compared to the previous two: a **master** branch with official releases, a **development** branch to merge in features and small fixes, a **release** branch for any pre-release work, and several **feature** branches for individual feature work.

Best described using a picture:

## Forks and Pull Requests

#### What if you want to contribute to a repo which you are not collaborator to?

#### Exercise: Fork a repo and create your first pull requests.

Use the repo importer to create a temporary copy of this repository for the purpose of the tutorial (change the name by adding the date). The students will practice contributing to this dummy repo, which could be deleted after the lesson. (This should be done before the lesson)

1. Show (best with two screens)
    - how to fork it, add a file, and submit a PR
    - how to review PR, discuss, request more details, and merge the PR.

2. Ask students to add a file to the repo named after their initials.

3. Try to merge all of them right away??? Stress that if their PR is pending and they push to a repo, the new commits will be automatically added to the PR

4. Ask all of them to work on modifying the same file.

    We will be working with the file [git-review.md](git-review.md).

    Assign a number to each participant and ask them to
    - respond to the corresponding question in their own words (if they have never seen the command they can google the answer but more important is their interpretation)
    - submit a PR with the modified file



***Did this activity cause some problems: why or why not?***

This was a very simple workflow in which you only work on master and all changes follow a line. But what if you want to work on different aspects of projects and we are not sure if in the end we will like our experiments to go into the main projects. It is still important to keep track of the changes so that we do not lose something important.


#### Exercise: Generate a pull request for a feature branch.

Inside of your fork (**YOUR_USERNAME/git-intermediate**):

* Create a branch named: **YOUR_INTIALS_branch** (e.g., brh_branch).
* Write more text in the file named after your initials.
* Push to the corresponding public branch.
* Merge the branch through Github with the **master** branch of the repo from which you forked.

## Navigating the Git Tree

A branch is really just a label on a specific commit. Best way to reason about the Git tree being static, then thinking of our location relative to the HEAD ref.

We call the HEAD ref detached when we move our HEAD (via `git checkout`, most commonly) to a non-branch tree.

-----
## Reset, Clean, Checkout, Revert

|Command|Scope|Common use cases|
|:------|:---:|:-----|
|git reset|Commit-level|Discard commits in a private branch or throw away uncommited changes|
|git reset|File-level|Unstage a file|
|git checkout|Commit-level|Switch between branches or inspect old snapshots|
|git checkout|File-level|Discard changes in the working directory|
|git revert|Commit-level|Undo commits in a public branch|
|git revert|File-level|(N/A)|
